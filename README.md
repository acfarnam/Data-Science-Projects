# Data Science Projects

This repository contains data science projects that I have completed during my time at university or on my own time.

- ## Machine Learning

  - [Classifying Pulsar Star Candidates](https://github.com/acfarnam/Data-Science-Projects/tree/master/Classifying%20Pulsar%20Stars%20using%20Machine%20Learning%20Models): Machine learning models to classify observations as pulsars or noise. 


- ## Deep Learning

  - [Predicting Asteroid Diameter Size with Neural Networks](https://github.com/acfarnam/Data-Science-Projects/tree/master/Predicting%20Asteroid%20Diameter%20using%20Neural%20Networks): Neural network trained and tuned to predict diameter of asteroids.

%  - Classifying Insect Images with Convolutional Neural Network: CNN that classifies insect images into 5 different classes (under construction).


- ## Time Series Analysis

  - [Forecasting COVID-19 Cases](https://github.com/acfarnam/Data-Science-Projects/tree/master/Time%20Series%20Analysis(COVID-19)): Various time series models that forecast the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases globally.


- ## Data Visualization

  - 3D Visualization of Housing Prices in Denver Neighborhoods: Webscrapping housing data from Zillow to build a 3D visualization of housing prices in Denver County, Colorado.
