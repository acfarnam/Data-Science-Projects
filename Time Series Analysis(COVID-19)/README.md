In January 2020 I was assigned a final project for my class in Time Series Analysis. Although the due date wasn't until late April, 
I was eager to get a headstart. I chose the COVID-19 data set not knowing that it would become a international pandemic. It made for a 
an ironic presentation, as I presented it remotely due to our university moving all online because of said pandemic. How funny, right?
